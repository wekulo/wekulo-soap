Hello!From sowcoders!
My project is about making of soap from alovera herbals<br>
reason why i started this project is becauses many people in my community are suffering from various diseases which has led to death<br>
my making of soap is making me supply all over the villagers,hospitals, schools e.t.c<br>
these may help the students, kids wash there hands reguraly and always be safe from these pandemic disease<br>the soap will be kept in bottles which may help them purchase in a cheap price<br>
soap of well chemicarized,does not have any germs, stored under cool temperature
these soap will be transported from door to door delivery helping those who leave mostly in villagers and not able to be reached by the goverment and the red cross<br>








</p>
we will distribute the alovera soap to the villagers, communities,counties,hospitals and schools<br>
it helps one to be more clean and look beutiful<br>
the soap also has some herbal which helps one to lack some of the diseases e.g skin diseases<br>
